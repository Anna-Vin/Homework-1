    <h1>Watch Blood Cells Stream around an Air Bubble—It’s Very Soothing.</h1>
    <a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dreamstime_xxl_80935812.jpg"><img src="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dreamstime_xxl_80935812.jpg" alt="Tree" width="300"></a>
    <p>Streaming across your screen are blood cells donated by the videographer himself: Martin Kaae Kristiansen, a
        self-described “microscopy enthusiast” behind the My Microscopic World project.

        Kristiansen, a former biomedical researcher, uses his personal microscope to document the tiniest examples of
        life wriggling around us. His YouTube, Twitter and Instagram accounts typically showcase individual organisms he
        collects from within about 30 miles of his home. They include creatures such as ticks, water fleas, and
        tardigrades—the eight-legged invertebrates that trundle around their impressive range of habitats like chubby,
        determined bears.</p>
    <p>Depending on what he has caught, Kristiansen’s four-year-old daughter may or may not want a peek. “She sometimes
        likes to watch the animals on my phone while I am observing them,” he says, “especially if they are large enough
        so that she can spot them before they go under the microscope.”</p>
    <p>For this video, Kristiansen visualized his own blood cells with a microscopy technique called dark-field
        illumination—which is why the cells appear goldenish on a black background rather than red on a white
        background. This method makes the cells look almost white, and it is created without having to artificially
        color—and kill—the sample. Each cell appears about 300 times larger than they are in real life. Because these
        microscopic disks are so dense that they crowd one another’s movements, Kristiansen diluted the blood by half
        with saltwater before hitting the record button on his iPhone. Though the ubiquitous phone cannot capture all
        that his microscope detects, it does an impressive job.</p>
