        <h1>What Monkeys Can Teach Humans about Resilience after Disaster</h1>
        <h3>Following Hurricane Maria, a Puerto Rican colony of rhesus macaques broadened their social networks. Could
            humans do the same post-COVID?</h3>

            <p>In September 2017, when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico, the storm first made landfall on a small island
                off
                the main island’s eastern coast called Cayo Santiago. At the time, the fate of Cayo Santiago and its
                inhabitants was barely a footnote in the dramatic story of Maria, which became Puerto Rico’s worst
                natural
                disaster, killing 3,000 people and disrupting normal life for months.

                But more than three years on, the unfolding recovery on the tiny island has something interesting to
                tell us
                about the critical role of social connections in fostering resilience. Santiago is home to some 1,500
                rhesus
                macaques who have been closely observed by scientists for decades. To everyone’s surprise, nearly all
                the
                monkeys survived the storm. That made their response to the devastation of Maria, which wiped out 60
                percent
                of the island’s vegetation, an unusual natural experiment. How would they cope? How would the
                competition
                for resources—food and shade—play out? Scientists also wondered whether the trauma of having experienced
                the
                storm might make the animals strengthen their existing bonds. Would they solely rely on their closest
                friends, as many humans have had to do during the COVID-19 pandemic?

                The monkeys reacted by changing their social order, it turned out. The macaques built broader and more
                tolerant social networks, according to a paper published today in Current Biology. “It’s a wholesale
                shift
                in the level of connectedness across the population,” says neuroscientist Michael Platt of the
                University of
                Pennsylvania, who is co-senior author of the study.

                The new paper “expertly addresses a deep and fundamental question” of how a social organization of
                primates
                (a category that of course includes humans) might rewire itself in the face of a threat, says physician
                and
                sociologist Nicholas Christakis of Yale University, who studies social networks and wasn’t involved in
                the
                research. “Can external stress in the form of natural disasters make our societies stronger if they do
                not
                wipe them out? This work shows that the answer is yes—or at least that social order is adaptive.”</p>

            <p>For 10 years, Platt and his colleagues have been working on Cayo Santiago with their partners at the
                University of Puerto Rico’s Caribbean Primate Research Center. They are just the most recent in a long
                line
                of scientists doing research on the island since the rhesus macaque colony was founded in 1938. The
                animals
                there are all descendants of an original group brought from India, and they are semi-wild: they face no
                predators and are fed once a day because, even before Maria, there has not been enough food on Santiago
                to
                sustain them. But their social interactions are otherwise entirely natural. That allows scientists to
                carefully track who does what to whom and who else is nearby at the time. These observations have added
                substantially to what we know about the evolution of social behavior and friendship.

                After the storm, the observers noticed that the monkeys seemed less aggressive. Were they really more
                tolerant of one another? To find out, the new paper compares two behaviors—proximity and grooming—during
                the
                three years before the storm and for one year afterward. Proximity, a form of social tolerance, is
                simply a
                measure of who sits next to whom. Grooming, a more active form of bonding, serves as a valuable social
                currency for rhesus macaques.</p>

            <p>The team hypothesized that the monkeys would intensify existing bonds, but that is not what happened. “We
                see
                this massive surge in the time they spend in proximity to other partners, and their social tolerance
                increasing toward many different partners,” says Camille Testard, lead author of the paper and a
                third-year
                graduate student in neuroscience at Platt’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania. “We saw active
                building
                of relationships with individuals that they didn’t really interact with before.”

                The biggest changes were seen in the animals who had been least sociable before. Grooming requires time
                and
                energy, Platt says. Presumably, the effort of building relationships had not seemed worth it for those
                animals before or was too stressful at that time, but the storm “really put the pressure on,” Testard
                says.
