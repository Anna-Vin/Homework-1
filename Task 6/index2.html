    <h1>‘Mother Trees’ Are Intelligent: They Learn and Remember</h1>

    <p>Few researchers have had the pop culture impact of Suzanne Simard. The University of British Columbia ecologist
        was the model for Patricia Westerford, a controversial tree scientist in Richard Powers’s 2019 Pulitzer
        Prize–winning novel The Overstory. Simard’s work also inspired James Cameron's vision of the godlike “Tree of
        Souls” in his 2009 box office hit Avatar. And her research was prominently featured in German forester Peter
        Wohlleben’s 2016 nonfiction bestseller The Hidden Life of Trees.

        What captured the public’s imagination was Simard’s findings that trees are social beings that exchange
        nutrients, help one another and communicate about insect pests and other environmental threats.</p>
    <p>Previous ecologists had focused on what happens aboveground, but Simard used radioactive isotopes of carbon to
        trace how trees share resources and information with one another through an intricately interconnected network
        of mycorrhizal fungi that colonize trees’ roots. In more recent work, she has found evidence that trees
        recognize their own kin and favor them with the lion’s share of their bounty, especially when the saplings are
        most vulnerable.

        Simard’s first book, Finding the Mother Tree: Discovering the Wisdom of the Forest, was released by Knopf this
        week. In it, she argues that forests are not collections of isolated organisms but webs of constantly evolving
        relationships. Humans have been unraveling these webs for years, she says, through destructive practices such as
        clear-cutting and fire suppression. Now they are causing climate change to advance faster than trees can adapt,
        leading to species die-offs and a sharp increase in infestations by pests such as the bark beetles that have
        devastated forests throughout western North America.</p>
    <p>Simard says people can take many actions to help forests—the world’s largest terrestrial carbon sink—recover and,
        in doing so, slow global warming. Among her most unconventional ideas is the pivotal role that the ancient
        giants she calls “mother trees” play in the ecosystem and our need to zealously protect them.</p>
